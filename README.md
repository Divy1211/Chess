# Chess
1. I have coded a chess engine in java, my code is a bit messy but i think it will be readable enough you can simply run the code by compiling the java file and then running it.
2. It is a two player chess and does not have AI. if you find a bug you can open a pull request

# Prerequisites
1. You should have Java installed.
2. You should also download and install [this](https://fonts2u.com/chess-alpha-2.font) font.

# How the program works

1. Two players can play this game

2. It shows the allowed moves on clicking a piece

3. It also prevents you from making invalid moves when king is under check
